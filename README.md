# VolumeControl

The OS of my smart phone is Android. It served me from the year 2012. Now its volume buttons are broken. 
Usually, it leads to factory mode after pressing power on button. Because "Power + Volume" will cause the phone to boot by Factory Mode.
It is really a frustrated experience.
In order to recover my phone from factory mode, I unscrew it and cut off the lines of volume control buttons.
At the result, I can not control the volume by hardware.
That's why I add this tiny codes to control the volume by software.
